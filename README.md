Minimise the new WHM sidebar

The new WHM/cPanel "Jupiter" theme has a new sidebar, which isn't collapsible (unless you have the browser window at a very small width).
This bookmarklet is essentially a toggle to show and hide the WHM toolbar, and it increases the width of the content to fill the new full width of the window.
It's very basic and not very tested, although its not going to cause any damage. Let me know if something doesn't look right.


## To install
Copy the contents of `whmsidebar.bookmarklet.js`, create a new bookmark in your browser (ideally on the Bookmarks tab) and paste the bookmarklet in the 'location' box. Name it whatever you like.
